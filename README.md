DOLFINx is the computational environment of
[FEniCSx](https://fenicsproject.org) and implements the FEniCS Problem
Solving Environment in C++ and Python.

DOLFINx is a new version of DOLFIN and is being actively developed.

## Documentation

Documentation can be viewed at:

- <https://docs.fenicsproject.org/dolfinx/main/cpp/>
- <https://docs.fenicsproject.org/dolfinx/main/python/>

## Installation

### From source

#### C++ core

To build and install the C++ core, in the ``cpp/`` directory, run::

```shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make install
```

#### Python interface

To install the Python interface, first install the C++ core, and then
in the ``python/`` directory run::

```shell
pip install .
```

(you may need to use ``pip3``, depending on your system).

For detailed instructions, see
<https://docs.fenicsproject.org/dolfinx/main/python/installation>.

### Spack

Spack automates the installation from source and is recommended for
building DOLFINx on HPC systems. To build the most recent release using
[Spack](https://spack.readthedocs.io/) (assuming a bash-compatible
shell):

```shell
git clone https://github.com/spack/spack.git
. ./spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh
spack env create fenicsx-env
spack env activate fenicsx-env
spack add py-fenics-dolfinx cflags="-O3" fflags="-O3"
spack install
```

See the Spack [documentation](https://spack.readthedocs.io/) for
comprehensive instructions.

### Binary

**Recommendations**

- macOS: [conda](#conda).
- Linux: [apt](#ubuntu-packages)
  ([Ubuntu](#ubuntu-packages)/[Debian](#debian-packages)),
  [docker](#docker-images) or [conda](#conda). See also [Spack](#spack).
- Windows: [docker](#docker-images), or install
  [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) and use
  [Ubuntu](#ubuntu-packages).

#### conda

To install the latest stable release of the Python interface, with
pyvista support for visualisation, using [conda](https://conda.io):

```shell
conda create -n fenicsx-env
conda activate fenicsx-env
conda install -c conda-forge fenics-dolfinx mpich pyvista
```

conda is distributed with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) and
[Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). The conda
recipe is hosted on
[conda-forge](https://github.com/conda-forge/fenics-dolfinx-feedstock).

> **Note**
> Windows packages are not available. This is due to some DOLFINx
> dependencies not supporting Windows.

#### Ubuntu packages

The [Ubuntu
PPA](https://launchpad.net/~fenics-packages/+archive/ubuntu/fenics)
contains binary packages of the FEniCSx components. To install:

```shell
add-apt-repository ppa:fenics-packages/fenics
apt update
apt install fenicsx
```

When a version of DOLFINx is released we aim to provide a build for the
latest stable version of Ubuntu. All other versions are provided on a
best-effort basis.

#### Debian packages

[DOLFINx](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/fenics-dolfinx) is included
with [various
versions](https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=python3-dolfinx&searchon=names&exact=1&suite=all&section=all)
of Debian. Install with `apt-get install fenicsx`.

#### Docker images

A Docker image with the latest stable release of DOLFINx:

```shell
docker run -ti dolfinx/dolfinx:stable
```

To switch between real and complex builds of DOLFINx/PETSc.

```shell
source /usr/local/bin/dolfinx-complex-mode
source /usr/local/bin/dolfinx-real-mode
```

```shell
docker run --init -ti -p 8888:8888 dolfinx/lab:stable  # Access at http://localhost:8888
```

A Docker image with DOLFINx built nightly:

```shell
docker run -ti dolfinx/dolfinx:nightly
```

A development image with all of the dependencies required
to build the latest stable release of the FEniCSx components:

```shell
docker run -ti dolfinx/dev-env:stable
```

A development image with all of the dependencies required
to build the `main` branch of the FEniCSx components:

```shell
docker run -ti dolfinx/dev-env:current
```

All Docker images support arm64 and amd64 architectures.
