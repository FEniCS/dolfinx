X3DOM Support README
author: Peter Scott

The files included in 'utils/x3dom' are support for visualizing solutions using the X3DOM framework. 

The functions included in the javascript file 'x3dom_support.js' are meant to allow for dynamic interaction 
with the visualized data. There are functions for converting the x3dom representation of vertices (a 
1d array of numbers) into a 3 dimensional representation, as well as for converting back to the x3dom 
representation. There are functions to add to and remove color from x3dom shapes as well as functions for 
adding a warped representation of the shape to the x3dom scene. Currently, only warping by a scalar is 
supported and the warp factor is determined by user input (using a slider). There are functions for adjusting 
the opacity, though currently these are not used since selection of shapes is necessary for adjusting opacity. 
Finally, there are functions to set up the ui functionality: these functions set up what happens on user 
interaction with the x3dom menu display.

The 'x3dom_support.css' file is used to style the menu display. The different components of the menu are 
given certain styles to ensure a uniform look as well as to ensure that the display does not cover up too 
much of the x3dom scene.
