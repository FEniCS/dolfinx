To build the unit tests using CMake, DOLFIN must be configured with
the DOLFIN_ENABLE_TESTING set. This will automatically be set when
running the cmake.local script in the top level directory (see the
INSTALL file for more info).

After DOLFIN has been built and installed successfully, make sure to
update the environment variables, for instance by sourcing
'dolfin.conf' in the build directory. Then, to run the complete test
suite, navigate to the build directory and enter

  make runtests

This will build and run all unit tests and (almost) all demos, both
C++ and Python versions. The tests will also be run in parallel,
unless the environment variable DISABLE_PARALLEL_TESTING has been set.

There are also other make targets that can be used depending on the
type of test that should be run. Here is a list of the most commonly
used targets for testing:

  make run_regressiontests  # run regression tests (demos) only
  make run_unittests        # run unit tests only
  make run_quicktest        # run only Python unit tests not marked 'slow'

Type 'make' followed by a space and tap 'tab' twice to see a complete
list of make targets.

To run individual tests, enter the desired test sub directory in the
build directory and start the test from there. For instance, to run
the LinearOperator.py Python unit tests, do

  cd build/test/unit/la/python
  python LinearOperator.py
