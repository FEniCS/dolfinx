This list functions as a project plan for the development of DOLFIN.

It works as follows: Pick something from the list, notify one of the
maintainers that you're working on it. When a task is done, it will
be deleted from this list and moved to the ChangeLog.

Ideally, each task should be assigned to a developer, including an
estimate of when the task should be ready.

Send suggestions, comments, and corrections to dolfin@math.chalmers.se.
