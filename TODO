This file lists TODO items for DOLFIN. As usual, the priority depends
on the current interests of the various DOLFIN developers.

To edit this file, it is convenient to install org-mode in Emacs.
It is available as part of Emacs 22 and can be invoked by M-x org-mode.
This gives convenient expand/collapse of bullets by pressing TAB.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Build system
** Demos are not built when using 'scons install . . . enableDemos=yes'
** Python interface sometimes not regenerated when changing header files
* Parallelisation
** Reordering in DofMap
** Generalise Assembler for parallel assembly
   - Should be possible to do with minor changes
   - Add something similar to what is done now for assembling
     over subdomains:

     if (partition(*cell) != this_process)
       continue;

** Figure out what to do with Functions in parallel
** Parallelize necessary parts of Mesh
   - Store both global and local indices for cell/vertex, add mesh
     functions for this
   - IO: read/write mesh in parallel (each processor reads/writes only
     its own part), should be doable with small extension of
     MeshEditor and XMLMesh
   - Adapt BoundaryComputation for parallel mesh, use knowledge about
     which vertices are shared to decide if a facet is a global or
     local boundary
   - Use parallel mesh information in DofMap to simplify
     implementation - should only need map from local to global cell/vertex
   - Use parallel mesh information in ParMETIS partitioning implementation

* Manual
** Write incomplete sections
** Write appendix on coding style
** Document Python interface

* Assembly
** Further develop and then merge parallel assembly

* Linear Algebra
** Refine initialisation of PETSc matrices for parallel case
** Refine PETSc wrappers for parallel assembly and solve
** Finalize GenericFoo interfaces and merge linear algebra with PyCC
   - Assigned to: Martin, Garth, Anders
* Mesh
** 1D and 2D cells in R^3
** Check coarsening
** Continue work on refinement
** Collect meshes on wiki

* Function
** Assignment from other than discrete functions (use evaluate_dof)
** Input/output for time-series
** Tensor-valued functions
** 'quadrature' function

* Input/Output
** Figure out what to do with i/o when running in parallel
* Solvers
** Create template for users to create solvers that use the DOLFIN library
* ODE solvers
** Solve dual and compute error estimate
** Automatic computation of stability factors as function of time T
* PDE solvers
** Improve NonlinearPDE
** Create TimeDependentPDE
   - Use ODE solvers
** Linear PDE should not own a Vector
* Parameters
** Load default parameters from file
** Add function to display all parameters
* Demos
** Add Python versions of all demos
