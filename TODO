This file lists TODO items for DOLFIN. As usual, the priority depends
on the current interests of the various DOLFIN developers. To edit this
file, it is convenient to install org-mode in Emacs.



* Parallelisation

** Expose only DofMap in DOLFIN (not ufc::dof_map)
** Reordering in DofMap
** Implement broadcast for Mesh (in MPIMeshCommunicator)
** Implement broadcast for MeshFunction (in MPIMeshCommunicator)
** Generalise Assembler for parallel assembly
   - Should be possible to do with minor changes
   - Add something similar to what is done now for assembling
     over subdomains:

     if (partition(*cell) != this_process)
       continue;

** Figure out what to do with Functions

* Manual

** Write incomplete sections
** Write appendix on coding style
** Document Python interface

* Assembly



* Linear Algebra

** Refine PETSc wrappers for parallel assembly and solve
** Finalize GenericFoo interfaces and merge linear algebra with PyCC
   - Assigned to: Martin, Garth, Anders

* Mesh

** Implement 1D meshes
** 1D and 2D cells in R^3
** Check coarsening
** Continue work on refinement
** Collect meshes on wiki

* Function

** Input/output for time-series
** Tensor-valued functions
** 'quadrature' function

* Input/Output

** Figure out what to do with i/o when running in parallel

* Solvers

** Create template for users to create solvers that use the DOLFIN library

* ODE solvers

** Solve dual and compute error estimate
** Automatic computation of stability factors as function of time T

* PDE solvers

** Improve NonlinearPDE
** Create TimeDependentPDE
   - Use ODE solvers

* Parameters
