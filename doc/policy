Guidelines for writing DOLFIN code.
-----------------------------------

In order to streamline the code a bit perhaps we should
keep sort of the same style when writing the code.

1. Class files are named exactly the same as the class name:

		GridGeometry.hh

2. Class header files end with .hh
   Other header files with .h
   Body files with .C
   Large letter only for class files: utils.h

3. Mixing of small and large letters in internal code:

		Settings::SetBoundaryConditions()

4. Small letters only in DOLFIN functions:

		dolfin_set_boundary_conditions()

5. DOLFIN stuff in dolfin.h starts with dolfin:

		dolfin_init()

6. DOLFIN constants start with DOLFIN and large letters:

		DOLFIN_BCTYPE_DIRICHLET

7. Header files start and end with something like

		#ifndef __GRID_GEOMETRY_HH
		#define __GRID_GEOMETRY_HH

		...

		#endif

8. Applying the GPL should look something like this at the top
   of all source files:

	// (c) 1999 Rickard Bergström, Chalmers Finite Element Center.
	// Licensed under the GNU GPL Version 2.
	//
	// Modifications by:
	//
	//   Johan Hoffman, Chalmers Finite Element Center
	//   Anders Logg,   Chalmers Finite Element Center

   or

	// (c) 2002 Johan Hoffman & Anders Logg, Chalmers Finite Element Center.
	// Licensed under the GNU GPL Version 2.

9. Include private header files as

	#include "file.h"

   and public header files as

	#include <dolfin/file.h>

   Private headers are those only used internally. Public headers are those
   that should be installed on the system.
