Guidelines for writing DOLFIN code.
-----------------------------------

In order to streamline the code a bit perhaps we should
keep sort of the same style when writing the code.

- Naming of classes:

	GridGeometry

- Naming of files:

	GridGeometry.h
	GridGeometry.cpp	

  Class files are named exactly the same as the class.
  Header files end with.h, implementation files with .cpp
  Large letter only for class files: utils.h

- Naming of variables:

    int my_variable;

- Naming of functions

    void myFunction()

- DOLFIN constants start with DOLFIN and large letters:

	DOLFIN_PI

- Header files start and end with something like

	#ifndef __GRID_GEOMETRY_H
	#define __GRID_GEOMETRY_H

	...

	#endif

- Applying the GPL should look something like this at the top
  of all source files:

	// Copyright (C) 2004-2005 Johan Hoffman and Anders Logg.
        // Licensed under the GNU GPL Version 2.
	//
        // First added:  2004-01-01
        // Last changed: 2005-11-15
  
  or

	// Copyright (C) 2004-2005 Johan Hoffman and Anders Logg.
        // Licensed under the GNU GPL Version 2.
        //
        // Modified by Andy R. Terrel, 2005.
        //
        // First added:  2004-01-01
        // Last changed: 2005-11-15

- enum types are lowercase

- The only part of PETSc that is visible outside of src/kernel/la are the functions
  Matrix::mat(), Vector::vec() etc.
