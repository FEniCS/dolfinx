## How to contribute

### Reporting bugs
If you find a bug in DOLFINx, please report it on the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/fenics/dolfinx/issues/new?labels=bug).

### Suggesting enhancements
If you want to suggest a new feature or an improvement of a current feature, you can submit this
on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/fenics/dolfinx/issues).

### Submitting a pull request
If you want to directly submit code to DOLFINx, you can do this by forking the repo, then submitting a pull request.
If you want to contribute, but are unsure where to start, have a look at the
[issues labelled "good first issue"](https://github.com/FEniCS/dolfinx/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).

On opening a pull request, unit tests will run on GitHub CI. You can click on these in the pull request
to see where (if anywhere) the tests are failing.

### Code of conduct
We expect all our contributors to follow the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Any unacceptable
behaviour can be reported to the FEniCS steering council (fenics-steering-council@googlegroups.com).
