def refine(mesh, cell_markers=None, redistribute=True):
    """
    Refine given mesh and return the refined mesh.

    *Arguments*
        mesh
            the :py:class:`Mesh <dolfin.cpp.Mesh>` to be refined.
        cell_markers
            an optional argument (a boolean :py:class:`MeshFunction
            <dolfin.cpp.MeshFunctionBool>` over cells) may be given
            to specify which cells should be refined. If no cell
            markers are given, then the mesh is refined uniformly.
        redistribute
            an optional argument (boolean) may be given to set whether
            to redistribute the mesh across processes following
            refinement. The is relevant only when the mesh is
            distributed across processes. In serial the argument has
            no impact. Default it True.

    *Examples of usage*

        .. code-block:: python

            mesh = refine(mesh)

        To only refine cells with too large error, define a boolean
        MeshFunction over the mesh and mark the cells to be refined
        as True.

        .. code-block:: python

            cell_markers = CellFunction("bool", mesh)
            cell_markers.set_all(False)
            for cell in cells(mesh):
                # set cell_markers[cell] = True if the cell's error
                # indicator is greater than some criterion.
            mesh = refine(mesh, cell_markers)

    """

    # This function is necessary to avoid copying in the wrapped
    # versions of the return-by-value refine functions in C++.

    # Create empty mesh
    refined_mesh = cpp.Mesh()

    # Call C++ refinement
    if cell_markers is None:
        cpp.refine(refined_mesh, mesh, redistribute)
    else:
        cpp.refine(refined_mesh, mesh, cell_markers, redistribute)

    return refined_mesh
