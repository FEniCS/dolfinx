"""This module provides functionality for cell-wise assembly of forms in
Python, corresponding to the C++ LocalSolver functionality.

The C++ :py:class:`assemble <dolfin.cpp.assemble_local>` function
is wrapped with an additional preprocessing step where code is generated
using the FFC JIT compiler."""

    *Arguments*
        Depending on the input form, which may be a functional, linear
        form or bilinear form, a scalar value, a vector or a matrix is 
        returned.

    The ``form`` can be either a UFL Form or a DOLFIN Form. The return value
    will be a Python float, or an appropriately sized numpy ndarray.
    
    To understand the connection between the returned local cell tensor and the
    global tensor the mapping can be found as normal from a function space as 
    V.dofmap().cell_dofs(cell.index()).
