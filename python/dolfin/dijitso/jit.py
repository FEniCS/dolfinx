def jit(jitable, name, params, generate=None,
        send=None, receive=None, wait=None):
    """Just-in-time compile and import of a shared library with a cache mechanism.

    A signature is computed from the name, params["generator"],
    and params["build"]. The name should be a unique identifier
    for the jitable, preferrably produced by a good hash function.

    The signature is used to identity if the library has already been
    compiled and cached. A two-level memory and disk cache ensures good
    performance for repeated lookups within a single program as well as
    persistence across program runs.

    If no library has been cached, the passed 'generate' function is
    called to generate the source code:

        header, source, dependencies = \
            generate(jitable, name, signature, params["generator"])

    It is expected to translate the 'jitable' object into
    C or C++ (default) source code which will subsequently be
    compiled as a shared library and stored in the disk cache.
    The returned 'dependencies' should be a tuple of signatures
    returned from other completed dijitso.jit calls, and are
    linked to when building.

    The compiled shared library is then loaded with ctypes and returned.

    For use in a parallel (MPI) context, three functions send, receive,
    and wait can be provided. Each process can take on a different role
    depending on whether generate, or receive, or neither is provided.

      * Every process that gets a generate function is called a 'builder',
        and will generate and compile code as described above on a cache miss.
        If the function send is provided, it will then send the shared library
        binary file as a binary blob by calling send(numpy_array).

      * Every process that gets a receive function is called a 'receiver',
        and will call 'numpy_array = receive()' expecting the binary blob
        with a compiled binary shared library which will subsequently be
        written to file in the local disk cache.

      * The rest of the processes are called 'waiters' and will do nothing.

      * If provided, all processes will call wait() before attempting to
        load the freshly compiled library from disk cache.

    The intention of the above pattern is to be flexible, allowing several
    different strategies for sharing build results. The user of dijitso
    can determine groups of processes that share a disk cache, and assign
    one process per physical disk cache directory to write to that directory,
    avoiding multiple processes writing to the same files.

    This forms the basis for three main strategies:

      * Build on every process.

      * Build on one process per physical cache directory.

      * Build on a single global root node and send a copy of
        the binary to one process per physical cache directory.

    It is highly recommended to avoid have multiple builder processes
    sharing a physical cache directory.
