    The communication graph is a directed graph that represents the

    of the array.

    Edges in the graph represent communication from the owning rank to
    the ranks that ghost the data. The edge data holds the (0) target
    node, (1) edge weight, and (2) an indicator for whether the
    receiving rank shares memory with the caller (``local==1``) or is a
    remote memory location (``local==0``). The node data holds the local
    size (number of owned indices) and the number of ghost indices.

    The graph can be processed using :meth:`comm_graph` to build data
    that can be used to build a `NetworkX <https://networkx.org/>`_
    directed graph.

        This function is collective across all MPI ranks. The graph is
