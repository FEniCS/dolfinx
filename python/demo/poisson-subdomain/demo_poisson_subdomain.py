#
# Poisson equation with multiple subdomains
# =========================================
#
# This demo is implemented in a single Python file,
# :download:`demo_poisson_subdomain.py`, which contains both the
# variational forms and the solver. The mesh file used in this demo is
# created in gmsh and could be downloaded from here
# :download:`poisson_subdomain.msh`. We suggest that you familiarize
# yourself with the :ref:`Poisson demo
# <demo_poisson_equation>` before studying this example,
# as some of the more standard steps will be described in less detail.
#
#
# The main purpose of this demo is to demonstrate how to
#
# * Convert a mesh containing various tagged regions into XDMF format.
# * Read the information regarding tagged regions in dolfin.
# * Create and integrate variational forms over distinct regions of a domain
#   and/or its boundaries.
#
# The domain under consideration in this demo will look as follows:

#
# Equation and problem definition
# -------------------------------
#
# For illustration purposes, we consider a weighted Poisson equation over
# a unit square: :math:`\Omega = [0,1] \times [0,1]` with mixed boundary
# conditions: find :math:`u` satisfying
#
# .. math::
#    - \mathrm{div} (a \nabla u) &= 1.0 \quad {\rm in} \ \Omega, \\
#                   u &= 5.0 \quad {\rm on} \ \Gamma_{T}, \\
#                   u &= 0.0 \quad {\rm on} \ \Gamma_{B}, \\
#                   \nabla u \cdot n &= - 10.0 \, \\
#                   e^{-(y - 0.5)^2} \quad {\rm on} \ \Gamma_{L}. \\
#                   \nabla u \cdot n &= 1.0 \quad {\rm on} \ \Gamma_{R}, \\
#
# where :math:`\Gamma_{T}`, :math:`\Gamma_{B}`, :math:`\Gamma_{L}`,
# :math:`\Gamma_{R}` denote the top, bottom, left and right sides of the
# unit square, respectively. The coefficient :math:`a` may vary over the
# domain: here, we let :math:`a = a_1 = 0.01` for :math:`(x, y) \in
# \Omega_1 = [0.5, 0.7] \times [0.2, 1.0]` and :math:`a = a_0 = 1.0` in
# :math:`\Omega_0 = \Omega \backslash \Omega_1`. We can think of
# :math:`\Omega_1` as an obstacle with differing material properties
# from the rest of the domain.
#
#
# Variational form
# ----------------
#
# We can write the above boundary value problem in the standard linear
# variational form: find :math:`u \in V` such that
#
# .. math::
#
#    a(u, v) = L(v) \quad \forall \ v \in \hat{V},
#
# where :math:`V` and :math:`\hat{V}` are suitable function spaces
# incorporating the Dirichlet boundary conditions on :math:`\Gamma_{T}`
# and :math:`\Gamma_{B}`, and
#
# .. math::
#
#    a(u, v) &= \int_{\Omega_0} a_0 \nabla u \cdot \nabla v \, {\rm d} x
#             + \int_{\Omega_1} a_1 \nabla u \cdot \nabla v \, {\rm d} x, \\
#    L(v)      &=  \int_{\Gamma_{L}} g_L v \, {\rm d} s
#             + \int_{\Gamma_{R}} g_R v \, {\rm d} s
#             + \int_{\Omega} f \, v \, {\rm d} x.
#
# where :math:`f = 1.0`, :math:`g_L = - 10.0 e^{-(y - 0.5)^2}` and
# :math:`g_R = 1.0`.
#
# Implementation
# --------------
#
# This description goes through the implementation (in
# :download:`demo_poisson_subdomain.py`) of a solver for the above
# described equation.
#
# First, the :py:mod:`dolfin` module is imported: ::

import meshio
import dolfin
from dolfin.io import XDMFFile
import numpy as np
from ufl import SpatialCoordinate, inner, grad, lhs, rhs, exp, dx, ds
from dolfin import FunctionSpace, TrialFunction, TestFunction, DirichletBC
from dolfin import Function, solve, MPI

# In this example, different boundary conditions are prescribed on
# different parts of the boundaries, and different parts of the interior
# have different material properties. This information must be made
# available to the solver.  One way of doing this, is to tag the
# different subregions with different (integer) labels, and later
# integrate over the specified regions. DOLFIN provides a class
# :py:class:`MeshFunction <dolfin.cpp.MeshFunction>` which is useful for
# these types of operations: instances of this class represent functions
# over mesh entities (such as over cells or over facets). Mesh functions
# can be read from file or, if explicit formulae for the domains are
# known, they can be constructed by way of instances of the
# :py:class:`SubDomain <dolfin.cpp.SubDomain>` class. In this example we
# are going to use an external meshing software `gmsh` to create the geometry
# and tag different regions within the domain. For details on how to create
# the mesh and tag different regions the reader is reffered to
# :ref:`Tagging mesh entities demo. <demo_tagging_mesh_entities>`. In this
# demo we begin by creating a Mesh Value Collection from the XDMF file. Since
# mixed topology elements are not allowed in FEniCS we have to separate
# the mesh entities of different dimensions into different XDMF files.
# This is achieved via ::

# Read the file generated by gmsh
mesh = meshio.read("poisson_subdomain.msh")

points, cells = mesh.points, mesh.cells
cell_data, field_data = mesh.cell_data, mesh.field_data

meshio.write("ps_mesh.xdmf",
             meshio.Mesh(
                 points=points[:, :2],  # Converting to 2D
                 cells={"triangle": cells["triangle"]},
                 cell_data={"triangle": {"subdomain": cell_data["triangle"]
                                         ["gmsh:physical"]}},
                 field_data=field_data))

meshio.write("ps_boundary.xdmf", meshio.Mesh(
    points=points[:, :2],  # Converting to 2D
    cells={"line": cells["line"]},
    cell_data={"line": {"boundaries": cell_data["line"]["gmsh:physical"]}}
))

# Once the XDMF files are created we could read them into dolfin: ::

with XDMFFile(MPI.comm_world, "ps_mesh.xdmf") as xdmf_infile:
    mesh = xdmf_infile.read_mesh(dolfin.cpp.mesh.GhostMode.none)
    mvc_subdomain = xdmf_infile.read_mvc_size_t(mesh, "subdomain")
    tag_info = xdmf_infile.read_information_int()

with XDMFFile(MPI.comm_world, "ps_boundary.xdmf") as xdmf_infile:
    mvc_boundaries = xdmf_infile.read_mvc_size_t(mesh, "boundaries")

# The file "ps_mesh.xdmf" contains information about the tagged regions of cell
# type 'triangle' and the file "ps_boundary.xdmf" contains information about
# the cell type 'line'. The mesh value collection mvc_subdomain and
# mvc_boundaries contains information about the integer tag of tagged
# elements. The variable tag_info is a dictionay where the key is string tag
# and the value is the correponding int tag. We would use this dictionay to
# specify Measures to integrate over specified regions and to specify
# different boundary conditions. The above mesh value collections are defined
# with the sole purpose of populating mesh functions.

mf_triangle = dolfin.cpp.mesh.MeshFunctionSizet(mesh, mvc_subdomain, 0)
mf_line = dolfin.cpp.mesh.MeshFunctionSizet(mesh, mvc_boundaries, 0)

# Now that the geometry is defined and labeled, we can move on to defining the
# input source functions: ::

a0 = 1.0
a1 = 0.01
x = SpatialCoordinate(mesh)
g_L = exp(- 10 * (- pow(x[1] - 0.5, 2)))
g_R = 1.0
f = 1.0

# Here, ``a0`` and ``a1`` represent the values of the coefficient
# :math:`a` in the two regions of the domain, ``g_L`` and ``g_R``
# represent the values of the Neumann boundary condition on the left and
# right boundaries respectively, and ``f`` represents the body source.
#
# We may now move on to define the variational equation. As usual, we
# start by defining a finite element function space and basis functions
# on this space: ::

# Define function space and basis functions
V = FunctionSpace(mesh, ("CG", 2))
u = TrialFunction(V)
v = TestFunction(V)

u5 = Function(V)
with u5.vector.localForm() as bc_local:
    bc_local.set(5.0)

u0 = Function(V)
with u0.vector.localForm() as bc_local:
    bc_local.set(0.0)

# With this function space, we can define the essential (Dirichlet)
# boundary conditions on the top and bottom boundaries. These boundaries
# correspond to the mesh function tagged by string tag ``TOP`` and ``BOTTOM``,
# respectively, in the ``mf_line`` mesh function: ::
print(tag_info)
# Define Dirichlet boundary conditions at top and bottom boundaries
bcs = [DirichletBC(V, u5, np.where(mf_line.values == tag_info['TOP'])[0]),
       DirichletBC(V, u0, np.where(mf_line.values == tag_info['BOTTOM'])[0])]

# DOLFIN predefines the "measures" ``dx``, ``ds`` and ``dS``
# representing integration over cells, exterior facets (that is, facets
# on the boundary) and interior facets, respectively. These measures can
# take an additional integer argument.  In fact, ``dx`` defaults to
# ``dx(0)``, ``ds`` defaults to ``ds(0)``, and ``dS`` defaults to
# ``dS(0)``. Integration over subregions can be specified by measures
# with different integer labels as arguments. However, we also need to
# map the geometry information stored in the mesh functions to these
# measures. The easiest way of accomplishing this is to define new
# measures with the mesh functions as additional input: ::

dx = dx(subdomain_data=mf_triangle)
ds = ds(subdomain_data=mf_line)

# We can now define the variational forms corresponding to the
# variational problem above using these measures and the tags for the
# different subregions.
# Here instead of using the integer labels we have used the dictionay
# "tag_info". This helps in properly definig the variational form with
# large number of tagged regions. Instead of using "ds(tag_info['LEFT'])"
# you can also use "ds(1)" and that would result in the same variational
# form. ::

# Define variational form
a = inner(a0 * grad(u), grad(v)) * dx(tag_info['DOMAIN']) + \
    inner(a1 * grad(u), grad(v)) * dx(tag_info['OBSTACLE'])


L = g_L * v * ds(tag_info['LEFT']) - \
    g_R * v * ds(tag_info['RIGHT']) - \
    f * v * dx(tag_info['DOMAIN']) - \
    f * v * dx(tag_info['OBSTACLE'])

# For simplicity, we define the full form first,
# and then extract the left- and right-hand sides using the UFL
# functions :py:func:`lhs` and :py:func:`rhs` afterwards. We can then
# :py:func:`solve <dolfin.fem.solving.solve>` as usual: ::

# Separate left and right hand sides of equation
# a, L = lhs(F), rhs(F)

# Solve problem
u = Function(V)
# solve(a == L, u, bcs)

# Now we can save the solution to a XDMF file for visualization. ::

with XDMFFile(dolfin.MPI.comm_world, "output.xdmf") as xdmf_outfile:
    xdmf_outfile.write(u)
