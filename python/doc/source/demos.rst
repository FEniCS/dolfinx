.. DOLFIN demos

Demos
=====


Introductory demos
------------------

These demos illustrate core DOLFIN/FEniCS usage and are a good way to
begin learning FEniCS. We recommend that you go through these examples
in the given order.

1. Getting started: :doc:`Poisson equation
   <demos/poisson/demo_poisson.py>`.

2. Using mixed, Taylor-Hood element: :doc:`Stokes equation
   <demos/stokes-taylor-hood/demo_stokes-taylor-hood.py>`

More advanced demos
-------------------

These examples typically demonstrate how to solve a certain PDE using
more advanced techniques. We recommend that you take a look at these
demos for tips and tricks on how to use more advanced or lower-level
functionality and optimizations.
