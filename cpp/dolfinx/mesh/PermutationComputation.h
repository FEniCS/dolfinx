  /// Compute (1) facet rotation and reflection data, and (2) cell
  /// permutation data. This information is used assemble of (1) facet
  /// inetgrals and (2) vector elements.
  ///
  /// 1. Get the permutation numbers to apply to facets. The
  ///    permutations are numbered so that:
  ///
  ///     - `n % 2` gives the number of reflections to apply
  ///     - `n // 2` gives the number of rotations to apply
  ///
  ///    Each column of the returned array represents a cell, and each
  ///    row a facet of that cell. This data is used to permute the
  ///    quadrature point on facet integrals when data from the cells on
  ///    both sides of the facet is used.
  ///
  /// 2. Get the permutation information about the entities of each
  ///    cell, relative to a low-to-high ordering. This data is packed
  ///    so that a 32 bit int is used for each cell. For 2D cells, one
  ///    bit is used for each edge, to represent whether or not the edge
  ///    is reversed: the least significant bit is for edge 0, the next
  ///    for edge 1, etc. For 3D cells, three bits are used for each
  ///    face, and for each edge: the least significant bit says whether
  ///    or not face 0 is reflected, the next 2 bits say how many times
  ///    face 0 is rotated; the next three bits are for face 1, then
  ///    three for face 2, etc; after all the faces, there is 1 bit for
  ///    each edge to say whether or not they are reversed.
  ///
  ///    For example, if a quadrilateral has cell permutation info
  ///    `....0111` then (from right to left):
  ///
  ///      - edge 0 is reflected (1)
  ///      - edge 1 is reflected (1)
  ///      - edge 2 is reflected (1)
  ///      - edge 3 is not permuted (0)
  ///
  ///    and if a tetrahedron has cell permutation info
  ///    `....011010010101001000` then (from right to left):
  ///
  ///      - face 0 is not permuted (000)
  ///      - face 1 is reflected (001)
  ///      - face 2 is rotated twice then reflected (101)
  ///      - face 3 is rotated once (010)
  ///      - edge 0 is not permuted (0)
  ///      - edge 1 is reflected (1)
  ///      - edge 2 is not permuted (0)
  ///      - edge 3 is reflected (1)
  ///      - edge 4 is reflected (1)
  ///      - edge 5 is not permuted (0)
  ///
  ///    This data is used to correct the direction of vector function
  ///    on permuted facets.
