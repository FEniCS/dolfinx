/// @brief Compute an directed graph that describes the parallel

///
/// The graph describes the communication pattern for a 'forward
/// scatter', i.e. sending owned data to ranks that ghost the data
/// (owner->ghost operation).
///
/// Each node in the graph corresponds to an MPI rank. A graph edge is
/// a forward (owner->ghost) communication path. The edge weight is
/// the number 'values' communicated along the edge. Each edge also
/// has a marker that indicates if the edge is sending data to:
///
/// 1. A node (rank) that shares memory with the sender (`true`), or
///
/// 2. A remote node that does not share memory with the sender
///   (`false`).
///
/// The graph data can be visualised using a tool like
/// [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/),
///
/// @note Collective.
///
/// @param[in] map Index map to build the graph for.
/// @param[in] root MPI rank on which to build the communication
/// graph data.
/// @return Adjacency list representing the communication pattern.
/// Edges data is (0) the edge, (1) edge weight (`weight`) and (2)
/// local/remote is memory indicator (`local==1` is an edge to a
/// shared memory node). Node data is (number of owned indices, number
/// of ghost indices).
