# UFL input for hyperleasticity
# =============================
#
# The first step is to define the variational problem at hand. We define
# the variational problem in UFL terms in a separate form file
# :download:`hyperElasticity.py`.
#
# We are interested in solving for a discrete vector field in three
# dimensions, so first we need the appropriate finite element space and
# trial and test functions on this space::
from basix.ufl import element
from ufl import (Coefficient, FunctionSpace, Identity, Mesh, TestFunction,
                 TrialFunction, derivative, det, diff, dx, grad, ln, tr,
                 variable)

# Function spaces
coord_element = element("Lagrange", "tetrahedron", 1, rank=1)
mesh = Mesh(coord_element)
e = element("Lagrange", "tetrahedron", 1, rank=1)
V = FunctionSpace(mesh, e)

# Trial and test functions
du = TrialFunction(V)     # Incremental displacement
v = TestFunction(V)      # Test function

# Note that ``element`` with `rank=1` creates a finite element space of vector
# fields. The dimension of the vector field (the number of components)
# is assumed to be the same as the spatial dimension (in this case 3),
# unless otherwise specified.
#
# Next, we will be needing functions for the boundary source ``B``, the
# traction ``T`` and the displacement solution itself ``u``::

# Functions
u = Coefficient(V)        # Displacement from previous iteration
# B = Coefficient(element)        # Body force per unit volume
# T = Coefficient(element)        # Traction force on the boundary

# Now, we can define the kinematic quantities involved in the model::

# Kinematics
d = len(u)
I = Identity(d)         # Identity tensor
F = variable(I + grad(u))         # Deformation gradient
C = F.T*F               # Right Cauchy-Green tensor

# Invariants of deformation tensors
Ic = tr(C)
J = det(F)

# Before defining the energy density and thus the total potential
# energy, it only remains to specify constants for the elasticity
# parameters::

# Elasticity parameters
E = 10.0
nu = 0.3
mu = E/(2*(1 + nu))
lmbda = E*nu/((1 + nu)*(1 - 2*nu))

# Both the first variation of the potential energy, and the Jacobian of
# the variation, can be automatically computed by a call to
# ``derivative``::

# Stored strain energy density (compressible neo-Hookean model)
psi = (mu/2)*(Ic - 3) - mu*ln(J) + (lmbda/2)*(ln(J))**2

# Total potential energy
Pi = psi*dx  # - inner(B, u)*dx - inner(T, u)*ds

# First variation of Pi (directional derivative about u in the direction of v)
F_form = derivative(Pi, u, v)

# Compute Jacobian of F
J_form = derivative(F_form, u, du)

# Compute Cauchy stress
sigma = (1/J)*diff(psi, F)*F.T

forms = [F_form, J_form]
elements = [e]
expressions = [(sigma, [[0.25, 0.25, 0.25]])]
