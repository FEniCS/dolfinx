Developer notes for the log library
-----------------------------------

* Some rules of thumb for the dolfin_error function.

  - The 'task' string should be sufficiently high level ("assemble form")
    to make sense to a user.
  - Use the same 'task' string from all errors originating from the same
    function.
  - The 'task' string should provide details of which particular algorithm
    or method that was used ("assemble form using OpenMP assembler").
  - The 'reason' string should try to explain why the task failed in the
    context of the task that failed ("subdomains are not yet handled").
  - Write "initialize mesh function" rather than "initialize MeshFunction".

  Some examples:

  dolfin_error("File.cpp",
               "open file",
               "Could not create directory \"%s\"",
               path.parent_path().string().c_str());

  dolfin_error("TriangleCell.cpp",
               "access number of entities of triangle cell",
               "Illegal topological dimension (%d)", dim);

  dolfin_error("VTKFile.cpp",
               "Create VTK file",
               "Unknown encoding (\"%s\"). "
               "Known encodings are \"ascii\", \"base64\" and \"compressed\"",
               encoding.c_str());

  dolfin_error("SubSystemsManager.cpp",
               "initialize PETSc subsystem",
               "DOLFIN has not been configured with PETSc support");

  dolfin_error("PETScKrylovSolver.cpp",
               "solve linear system with PETSc Krylov solver",
               "Matrix does not have a nonzero number of rows and columns");
