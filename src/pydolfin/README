PyDOLFIN - A Python module wrapper for DOLFIN
---------------------------------------------

Introduction:

The idea behind PyDOLFIN is that DOLFIN should be usable from Python.
This enables much simpler testing, experimenting, demonstration. 
For some applications it could likely replace the C++ interface entirely.

Installation:

PyDOLFIN requires a correctly configured DOLFIN source tree, as well
as an installation of DOLFIN. With that in place, simply type "make"
in "src/pydolfin" to build the module, then "python setup.py install"
to install it (a standard Python module installation procedure).
Possibly "python setup.py install --prefix=/your/local/directory/"
if you do not wish a system-wide install.

If the DOLFIN interface has changed, you may need to regenerate the
SWIG interface. Simply do "touch dolfin.i" followed by make to rebuild.

Usage:

PyDOLFIN is used just like any Python module:

>>> from dolfin import *
>>> dolfin_get("tolerance")
0.10000000000000001
>>> 

See the included demos for usage examples, for example "settingsdemo.py".
