Documenting DOLFIN demos
========================

The documentation for the DOLFIN demos is written by hand and located
together with the demos in the DOLFIN source tree. To document a (new)
DOLFIN demo located in the directory foo (for instance pde/poisson),
follow the two steps below. In general, the simplest way is probably
to look at one of the documented demos for instance
(demo/pde/poisson/) and follow the same setup.

1) Add these 3 files

  * foo/common.txt -- containing common information such as the main
    features the demo illustrates and, if applicable, a mathematical
    description of the differential equation that is solved. This file
    should then be included in the C++ and Python versions.

  * foo/cpp/documentation.rst -- containing the reST source file with
    the documentation that is specific to the C++ version of the demo.

  * foo/python/documentation.rst -- containing the reST source file
    with the documentation that is specific to the Python version of
    the demo.

   If either the C++ or the Python version of the demo does not exist,
   feel free to add the version and continue.

2) Move the directory foo from the directory undocumented/ to the
   suitable directory (for instance pde/ or la/).


Note

   The demo documentation is automatically included in the complete
   DOLFIN documentation when running make doc after building
   DOLFIN. While documenting a demo, it may be handy to only run
   make doc_demo and then make doc_html_[python|cpp].

Note

   Tests for the validity of the code snippets used in the demo
   documentation are included in the standard DOLFIN tests.

C++ and Python specific contents
================================

The C++ and Python documentation reST source files should

* Explain each step of the solution procedure. Do this by including
  and explaining code snippets from the demo source code.

* Include links to the API documentation using the :cpp:class: and
  :py:class: directives. Note that for the Python classes, the
  full module path is required (for instance
  py:class:dolfin.cpp.NewtonSolver)

* Include the complete set of files needed to run the demo using the
  include directive.
