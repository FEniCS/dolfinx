This demo illustrates how to:

* Solve a linear partial differential equation with Neumann boundary conditions
* Use mixed finite element spaces

The solution for  :math:`u` in this demo will look as follows:

Equation and problem definition:
--------------------------------------


The Poisson equation is the canonical elliptic partial differential equation. For a domain :math:`\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n` with boundary :math:`\partial \Omega`, the Poisson equation with particular boundary conditions reads:

.. math::

	- \nabla^{2} u &= f \quad {\rm in} \ \Omega, \\
    \nabla u \cdot n &= g \quad {\rm on} \ \partial \Omega.

Here, :math:`f` and :math:`g` are input data and :math:`n` denotes the outward directed boundary normal. Since only Neumann conditions are applied, :math:`u` is only determined up to a constant :math:`c` by the above equations. An addition constraint is thus required, for instance:

.. math::

	\int u \, {\rm d} x = 0 

This can be accomplished by introducing the constant :math:`c` as an additional unknown (to be sought in :math:`\mathbb{R}`) and the above constraint.

Our variational form reads: Find :math:`(u, c) \in V \times R` such that

.. math::


	a((u, c), (v, d)) = L((v, d)) \quad \forall \ (v, d) \in V \times R,



.. math::

	a((u, c), (v, d)) &= \int_{\Omega} \nabla u \cdot \nabla v \, {\rm d} x
						+ \int_{\Omega} cv \, {\rm d} x
						+ \int_{\Omega} ud \, {\rm d} x, \\
	L(v)    &= \int_{\Omega} f v \, {\rm d} x
    	     	+ \int_{\Gamma_{N}} g v \, {\rm d} s,

:math:`V` is a suitable function space containing :math:`u` and :math:`v`, and :math:`R` is the space of real numbers.

The expression :math:`a(\cdot, \cdot)` is the bilinear form and :math:`L(\cdot)` is the linear form.

In this demo we shall consider the following definitions of the domain and input functions:


	
* :math:`\Omega = [0, 1] \times [0, 1]` (a unit square) 
* :math:`g = - \sin(5x)` (normal derivative) 
* :math:`f = 10\exp(-((x - 0.5)^2 + (y - 0.5)^2) / 0.02)` (source term)
