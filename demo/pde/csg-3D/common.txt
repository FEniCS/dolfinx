This demo illustrates how to:

* Define Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG)
* Generate mesh from geometries

The domain looks as follows:

.. image:: ../csg3D_boundary.png
	:scale: 75 %

and the mesh:

.. image:: ../csg3D_mesh.png
	:scale: 75 %


Problem definition
------------------

We do not have any equation in this demo. The demo focuses purely on the geometry and how to generate a mesh from it.
