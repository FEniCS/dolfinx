"""This demo program solves Poisson's equation

    - div grad u(x, y) = f(x, y)

on the unit square with source f given by

    f(x, y) = 10*exp(-((x - 0.5)^2 + (y - 0.5)^2) / 0.02)

and boundary conditions given by

    u(x, y) = 0        for x = 0 or x = 1
du/dn(x, y) = sin(5*x) for y = 0 or y = 1
