Multi-adaptive solver
---------------------

- Save dual solution backwards
- Error estimates
- Optimization and benchmarks, including control of the error estimates
- Automatic computation of stability factors as function of time T
- Stiff problems, adaptive damping
- Examples: Lorenz, sin-cos, stiff problems, cow, solar system

General

- Save edges in matlab format: Svensson?
- General boundary conditions: Kraft?
- Multigrid: Svensson, Målqvist?
- Vector valued PDE: Hoffman, Logg (Bengzon, Jansson ?)
- General function representations: Hoffman, Logg, Jansson
- i/o for functions, in particular in OpenDX format: Logg
- Use libtool: anyone?
